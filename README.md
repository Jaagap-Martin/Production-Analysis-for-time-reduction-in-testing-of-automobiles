## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Automobile manufacturing involves multiple stages of production and quality testing. Optimizing testing time without compromising quality is critical for increasing plant throughput.

**Objective**:  
To build a predictive model that estimates the testing time (`y`) for parts/components based on their process parameters and categorical identifiers.
